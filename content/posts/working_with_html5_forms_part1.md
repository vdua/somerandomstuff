title: Working with Mobile Forms
description: Adobe's HTML5 Form solution provides a rendition similar to dynamic forms with some minor differences. One such difference is how the fonts are to be used. In PDF Forms, font can be embedded inside the PDF File while that is not the case with HTML 5 Forms which assumes font to be present on client's machine. But with web fonts, customer's can achieve the same with just little bit of code
